# Why Choose Us?

✅ **1. For Education Students Only – Skilled & Passionate**  
We exclusively recruit students studying education, early childhood, or language-related degrees. They’ve got the teaching know-how and genuinely understand children’s needs — real educators at heart.

✅ **2. High-Quality, Great Value – But Often Overlooked**  
Education students have the skills and potential, but often lack opportunities due to visa or schedule limitations. Our platform connects families with reliable, high-quality companions at a fair cost.

✅ **3. Legal Visas & Safe Backgrounds**  
Every companion holds a valid Australian student visa and has completed a WWCC, Blue Card, or Police Check — giving you extra peace of mind.

✅ **4. Flexible & Commitment-Free**  
We don’t take commissions or lock you into contracts. Rates and working style are agreed upon between you and the companion — flexible, transparent, and low-pressure.

✅ **5. Bilingual Support – Great for Chinese Families**  
Our platform supports both English and Chinese. Many companions speak Mandarin or Cantonese, ensuring smooth communication with no language barriers.

✅ **6. More Than Care – It’s Interactive Learning**  
Companions engage with children through play, reading, and conversation. The experience goes beyond supervision — it’s about sparking growth and learning together.
