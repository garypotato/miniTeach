# Project Specification

## Overview

This is a **Next.js** project designed to assist **parents** in finding suitable **companions** to look after their children. The platform displays a list of companions along with their details. If a parent wishes to obtain a companion's contact information, they must contact us directly. We will provide the necessary details privately.

---

## Website State Management

- Use **Redux** to manage the application state.

---

## Data Source

The project uses **Shopify** as the backend database.

### Collections in Use

1. **Companion**
2. **Q & A**
3. **Information**
4. **Parent**

Each **companion** is stored as a product under the `Companion` collection and includes the following **metafields**:

- `wechat_id`
- `major`
- `education`
- `language`
- `age`
- `location`
- `age_group`
- `blue_card`
- `police_check`
- `skill`
- `certification`
- `availability`
- `user_name`
- `password`
- `last_name`
- `first_name`

> Uses [`shopify-api-node`](https://github.com/MONEI/Shopify-api-node) to fetch products from Shopify.  
> All API credentials are securely stored in the `.env` file.

## Code Standards

- Use **Server-side Rendering (SSR)** and **server-side data fetching** as the default.
- Use **client-side fetching** only when absolutely necessary.
- Use the `GlobalModal` component to:
  - Show loading indicators during data fetching
  - Wrap components like `SearchFilter`
- Follow the **DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)** principle:
  - Reuse shared components and utilities before building new ones.
- Encapsulate all Shopify API logic inside a dedicated folder:
  - `lib/shopify/` or `services/shopify/`
