# How the Platform Works

This section outlines the end-to-end process of how companions and parents interact with the platform.

## 1. Companion Registration

Prospective companions register on the platform by completing an onboarding questionnaire. This form captures all relevant information such as education, skills, and certifications.

## 2. Companion Verification

Once submitted, the registration is reviewed by our support team. Only companions who pass this validation process will be listed on the platform.

- Any time a companion updates their profile, it must go through another round of verification before changes are reflected publicly.

## 3. Parent Browsing

Parents can browse the platform and explore available companions. Each profile includes detailed information to help parents find a suitable match.

## 4. Requesting Contact Information

When a parent is interested in a particular companion, they must contact our support team. The support team will:

- Validate the parent's identity and intent
- Ensure the parent meets our reliability criteria

## 5. Private Introduction

If the parent is deemed trustworthy, the companion's contact information will be shared privately. Communication between the parent and companion then continues off-platform.

> **Note**: The platform does not charge any fees for this service.
